#Description: Personal project to create a voice based computer use agent with python and cpp that uses the llama3 API to manage command parsing 

Current In-Progress Edits:
- Currently working on improving the manual parser to accommodate more complex statements
- Trying to replace the llama API with IBM Watson Orchestrate
- Hoping to make the UI more complex for the user and provide overlayed cues for people to actively see the programs intentions based on voice commands
