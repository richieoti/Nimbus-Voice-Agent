Description: Personal project to create a voice based computer use agent with python and cpp that uses the llama3 API to manage command parsing 

- Main code function is in the NimbusVoice.py which contains the audio collection, command parsing, and UI interface
- NimbusCommands.cpp contains all the functions needed to carry out virtual hardware inputs on the device based on commands
- NimbusCommands.hpp is the header file for creating a python library that uses the functions in NimbusCommands via Cython
- NimbusVoice.cpp, NimbusVoice.pyx, and setup.py are construction files generated by Cython to convert the cpp functions into an internal library for python
- The Nimbus pyd file is the final python library generated by Cython that is utilized when Nimbus Voice is imported in python

Current In-Progress Edits:
- Currently working on improving the manual parser to accommodate more complex statements
- Trying to replace the llama API with IBM Watson Orchestrate
- Hoping to make the UI more complex for the user and provide overlayed cues for people to actively see the programs intentions based on voice commands
